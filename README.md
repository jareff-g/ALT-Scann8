## ALT-Scann8 User Interface - Super 8 / 8mm film scanner software to be used with T-Scann8 scanner

This UI is a fork of Torulf Holmström’s “T-Scann8-UserInterface v2.1” ([CC BY-NC 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)). ALT-Scann8 is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jareff-g/ALT-Scann8/blob/main/LICENSE) by Juan Remirez de Esparza.

### Purpose
Originally adapted to support the PiCamera2 library for Bullseye 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS, we’ve expanded it with refactoring and new features.

### Key Enhancements
- **PiCamera2 Integration**: Full support for Bullseye 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS with modern camera controls.
- **Tkinter UI**: Lightweight, responsive interface replacing Pygame, with streamlined widget layout.
- **Post-View Mode**: Fast, custom preview for real-time film alignment, outpacing PiCamera2’s default.
- **Exposure Flexibility**: Auto-exposure with adjustable delays, multi-exposure capture (up to 5 bracketed shots), and manual overrides.
- **FrameSync Viewer**: Interactive tool to manually align tricky frames (e.g., overexposed or damaged), with zoom and threshold tweaks.
- **Misalignment Detection**: Real-time frame error checking (Super 8/Regular 8), with DNG support via rawpy—catches friction-based drift.
- **Film Transport**: Enhanced fast-forward/rewind with progressive stops and gate protection, plus auto-stop at reel end.
- **Workflow Persistence**: Auto-saved settings and session data (e.g., frame counts, folders) for seamless restarts.
- **UI Polish**: Tooltips, resizable fonts, QR code debug aids, and a rolling plotter for PT level tuning.
- **Stability**: Robust error handling (e.g., disk space, folder issues) and bug fixes for smooth scanning.

## ALT-Scann8 Controller

The controller manages the Arduino board, forked from Torulf Holmström’s “Arduino to Card Control T-Scann 8 v1.61.”

### Purpose
Started to add a feature, it evolved with refactoring and enhancements.

### Key Enhancements
- **Code Refactor**: Cleaner, maintainable structure for reliability.
- **Transport Precision**: Fast-forward/rewind with progressive stops and improved winding for consistent tension.
- **Safety Locks**: Prevents FF/Rewind with film in the gate, plus auto-stop on reel end.
- **Pi Sync**: Enhanced I2C communication with UI, reporting PT levels and controller version.
- **Startup Sync**: First-frame alignment now locks in within one frame (vs. up to five).

### Important Notes
- **Compatibility**: Use both ALT-Scann8 UI and Controller together—interface changes (as of October 2023) break compatibility with original T-Scann 8 software.
- **Performance**: For best results, add a pinch roller (see [T-Scann 8 Mods](https://github.com/jareff-g/ALT-Scann8/wiki/T%E2%80%90Scann-8-mods)) to aid capstan traction.

## Getting Started
1. **Download**: Get the repo via [ZIP](https://github.com/jareff-g/ALT-Scann8/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or `git clone https://github.com/jareff-g/ALT-Scann8.git`.
2. **Python Setup**:
   - Update your system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`.
   - Install required libraries: 
     ```bash
     sudo apt install -y python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-pil python3-psutil python3-qrencode python3-smbus python3-picamera2 python3-rawpy
     ```
   - Optional for usage reporting: `sudo apt install -y python3-requests`.
   - Tkinter is included with Python 3.
3. **Arduino Setup**:
   - Open `Controller/ALT-Scann8-Controller.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Compile and upload to your Arduino board.
4. **Run**: On your Raspberry Pi, execute `python3 ALT-Scann8.py`.

### Usage Reporting
ALT-Scann8 optionally pings an anonymous usage count (UI+Controller version pair) to track active users and compatibility. Enable it at first run—no personal data collected. See `ALT-Scann8.py` for details.
